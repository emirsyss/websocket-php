# PHP WebSocket
A project I made casually to learn how to use Web Socket in PHP using Ratchet.


## The logic works like this:
- You must install this with Composer.  `composer require cboden/ratchet`
- Then, you should open the console and log in to the **bin** folder and start the server by typing `php server.php` here.

Then all you have to do is log in to index.php. It will automatically log in to the server. You can now move the **player** div with the arrow keys. You can try this by entering from different browsers. You can connect to the server from all browsers **(multiplayer)** and you will see that your movements are transmitted to all browsers, that is, clients, in **real time.**
